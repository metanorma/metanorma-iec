                    The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) is a worldwide
                    organization for standardization comprising all national
                    electrotechnical committees (IEC National Committees). The object
                    of IEC is to promote international co-operation on all questions
                    concerning standardization in the electrical and electronic
                    fields. To this end and in addition to other activities, IEC
                    publishes International Standards, Technical Specifications,
                    Technical Reports, Publicly Available Specifications (PAS) and
                    Guides (hereafter referred to as &#8220;IEC
                    Publication(s)&#8221;). Their preparation is entrusted to
                    technical committees; any IEC National Committee interested in the
                    subject dealt with may participate in this preparatory work.
                    International, governmental and non-governmental organizations
                    liaising with the IEC also participate in this preparation. IEC
                    collaborates closely with the International Organization for
                    Standardization (ISO) in accordance with conditions determined by
                    agreement between the two organizations.

                    The formal decisions or agreements of IEC on technical matters
                    express, as nearly as possible, an international consensus of
                    opinion on the relevant subjects since each technical committee
                    has representation from all interested IEC National Committees.

                    IEC Publications have the form of recommendations for
                    international use and are accepted by IEC National Committees in
                    that sense. While all reasonable efforts are made to ensure that
                    the technical content of IEC Publications is accurate, IEC cannot
                    be held responsible for the way in which they are used or for any
                    misinterpretation by any end user.

                    publications. Any divergence between any IEC Publication and the
                    corresponding national or regional publication shall be clearly

                    The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) is a worldwide
                    organization for standardization comprising all national
                    electrotechnical committees (IEC National Committees). The object
                    of IEC is to promote international co-operation on all questions
                    concerning standardization in the electrical and electronic
                    fields. To this end and in addition to other activities, IEC
                    publishes International Standards, Technical Specifications,
                    Technical Reports, Publicly Available Specifications (PAS) and
                    Guides (hereafter referred to as &#8220;IEC
                    Publication(s)&#8221;). Their preparation is entrusted to
                    technical committees; any IEC National Committee interested in the
                    subject dealt with may participate in this preparatory work.
                    International, governmental and non-governmental organizations
                    liaising with the IEC also participate in this preparation. IEC
                    collaborates closely with the International Organization for
                    Standardization (ISO) in accordance with conditions determined by
                    agreement between the two organizations.
